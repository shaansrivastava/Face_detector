# Face_detector
Face detector uses Harr Cascade Classifier to classify the faces in the images or the video.
Various positive and negative images have been already classified in the xml file.
So, the opencv library just uses detectMultiScale to detect the faces.
The code can be modified as required to use the project on a image or a video.
